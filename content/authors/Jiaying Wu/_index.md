# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Prof. Jiaying Wu is an assistant Professor in the Advanced Materials Thrust, Function Hub, HKUST(GZ) and affiliate assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The HKUST. Her research addresses the device physics and photophysics of new materials for solar energy conversion, including organic and perovskite solar cells as well as materials for photon driven photo-detecting. Her current research focuses on developing fundamental understandings of charge carrier dynamics in photon energy conversion materials/devices by using ultrafast spectroscopy and transient optoelectronic characterizations. She is leading an advanced characterization and analysis team at HKUST(GZ) to address and underpin the fundamental challenges for the next generation materials and technologies.
